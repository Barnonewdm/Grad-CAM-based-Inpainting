    "As you can see we go from the raw pixels of the images to increasingly abstract and compact representations. The representations downstream start highlighting what the network pays attention to, and they show fewer and fewer features being \"activated\"; most are set to zero. This is called \"sparsity.\" Representation sparsity is a key feature of deep learning.\n",

    "As you can see, we are **overfitting** like it's getting out of fashion. Our training accuracy (in blue) gets close to 100% (!) while our validation accuracy (in green) stalls as 70%. Our validation loss reaches its minimum after only five epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we have a relatively small number of training examples (2000), overfitting should be our number one concern. Overfitting happens when a model exposed to too few examples learns patterns that do not generalize to new data, i.e. when the model starts using irrelevant features for making predictions. For instance, if you, as a human, only see three images of people who are lumberjacks, and three images of people who are sailors, and among them the only person wearing a cap is a lumberjack, you might start thinking that wearing a cap is a sign of being a lumberjack as opposed to a sailor. You would then make a pretty lousy lumberjack/sailor classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting is the central problem in machine learning: given that we are fitting the parameters of our model to a given dataset, how can we make sure that the representations learned by the model will be applicable to data never seen before? How do we avoid learning things that are specific to the training data?\n",
